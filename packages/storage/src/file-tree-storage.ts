 * Design rationale:
 * - Uses AsyncIterable/Iterable for entries instead of loading entire trees
 * - Consistent with ObjectStorage pattern (AsyncIterable<Uint8Array>)
 * - Memory efficient for large directories
 * - Implementation buffers internally for Git serialization (sorting/hashing)
 *
 * Implementation notes (JGit patterns):
 * - Trees are serialized as binary: `mode name\0<20-byte-sha1>` per entry
 * - Mode is stored as ASCII octal digits without leading zeros (except for trees)
 * - Names are UTF-8 encoded, terminated by null byte
 * - Hash is stored as raw 20 bytes (not hex)
 * - Entries must be canonically sorted for consistent hashing
